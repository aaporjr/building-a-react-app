In this guide you are going to create Grails app using React as a view layer. You will be using the 1.x version of the React profile (single project, using Webpack and the Asset Pipeline).

NOTE: A few changes were made to the initial project (compared to a default Grails project using the 1.x React profile). A quick diff of the changes is provided here [TODO: Provide link to Git diff]
