Now that our `Garage` component is set up and rendering the `Vehicles` table on our page, we can finally hook up our API to load data into our React views. We'll use the `fetch` API for this purpose.

Install `fetch` via `npm`:

[source,bash]
----
~ npm install --save whatwg-fetch
----


Edit `src/main/webapp/app/garage.js`:

[source,javascript]
----
//...
import 'whatwg-fetch';    // <- Import the fetch library

require('./../styles/style.css');

class Garage extends React.Component {

  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      vehicles: []         // <- remove the hard-coded data
    }
  }

  componentDidMount() {    // <-- load data from our API
    fetch('/vehicle')
      .then(r => r.json())
      .then(json => this.setState({vehicles: json}))
      .catch(error => console.error('Error retrieving vehicles: ' + error));

//...

`componentDidMount` is one of React's component lifecycle methods. It is fired as soon as the component is loaded on a page.  In this method, we use `fetch` to make a request (a GET request by default) to our `/vehicle` endpoint, parse the JSON payload, and call `this.setState` to update our `vehicles` collection with the data.

Restart the app (or wait for webpack to reload) to see the changes. You should now see the list of Vehicles from the Grails app displayed in the React `Vehicles` table.
